## Development 

Made using turtle library built-in to Python. Turtle is a lighter weight UI library compared to PyGame, which is traditionally used to make simple games with Python.

## How To Play

Player A uses "w" and "s" keys to move the left most paddle up and down, respectively.

Player B uses the up and down arrows to move the right most paddle.
